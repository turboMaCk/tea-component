{-| In some case it makes sense to postpone initialization
of some module after some action like for instance a router change.

Such part of state can expressed using `Maybe` type like

    type alias Model
        { about : About.Model
        , userSettings : Maybe UserSettings.Model
        }

or for instance using sum type like

    type Model
        = About About.Model
        | UserSettings UserSettings.Model

In such case though programmer is responsible for manually initializing
the module at the right time.
